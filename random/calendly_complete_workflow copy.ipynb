      "On March 11, 2025, Indonesian authorities successfully rescued a critically endangered two-month-old male Sumatran elephant that had become separated from its mother in a palm oil plantation. The calf was found in Riau province on Sumatra island after residents alerted the authorities. Sumatran elephants are on the brink of extinction, with only about 2,400-2,800 individuals remaining worldwide. This rescue represents a significant effort in the conservation of this endangered species.
